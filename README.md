# CS893-Semantic-Segmentation
In this project, I am doing semantic segmentation on MonuSeg Dataset using different segmentation techniques which are U-Net, Segnet and DeepLab-v3.

## 1. U-Net
(Modified the original implementation at https://github.com/hlamba28/UNET-TGS/blob/master/TGS%20UNET.ipynb for this dataset)

* Accuracy (on Test Data) = 0.82
* Dice Score = 0.41
* ###### Learning Curve:

## 2. SegNet
## 3. DeepLab-v3
